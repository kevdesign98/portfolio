# Portfolio

I wanted to learn 3D web development, and decided to create my portfolio into an interactive 3D world built using [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/) and [Babylon.js](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js),i had an absolute blast making this!

Try it out! [https://kevdesign98.github.io/portfolio/webgl.html](https://kevdesign98.github.io/portfolio/webgl.html)

## Motivation

I discovered an amazing world of web rendering. There are so many incredible web projects out there, and I wanted to learn this technology. I was inspired by many awesome projects, but specifically examples from the [A-Frame](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe/) , and [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/).

## Features
